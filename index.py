culture = [
    "what's Sri Lankan culture like?",
    "Tea, temples, tuk-tuks, and gossip faster than Wi-Fi. Respect your elders, survive the spice, and never trust “Just come for tea” – you’re staying for hours. 😏",
    "Why visit Sri Lanka?",
    "It’s paradise with a side of chaos. Beaches, jungles, ruins… and tea so good the British stole it.",
    "What’s the best thing to do here?",
    "Ride a tuk-tuk like a warlord, eat curry that’ll make you sweat out your sins, and sip Ceylon tea where empires once plotted.",
    "Is it safe?",
    "Safer than a pirate’s hideout, as long as you don’t challenge a local to an arrack-drinking contest.",
    "Why invest in Sri Lanka?",
    "Land’s rich, labor’s cheap, and the government will probably give you tax breaks while they figure out how to fix the economy.",
    "What’s the food like?",
    "Spicier than colonial betrayals, and you’ll love every bite until your stomach starts a rebellion.",
    "Best way to travel?",
    "Train rides through the hills are poetry. Tuk-tuks are chaos. Buses? Only if you like living on the edge.",
    "Why is Ceylon tea famous?",
    "Because the British built an empire on it. Now you can sip it like a king… or a thief who stole it back.",
    "Any scams to watch out for?",
    "If a local says, “Special price, just for you,” it means you’re about to fund their next vacation.",
    "What’s the nightlife like?",
    "Think colonial excess but with cheaper drinks and more questionable decisions.",
    "Why start a business here?",
    "Because fortune favors the bold… and Sri Lanka loves foreign investors with deep pockets.",
    "How’s the weather?",
    "Hot like a cannon blast, wet like a monsoon raid. Pick your battle.",
    "What’s the deal with Sri Lankan beaches?",
    "White sand, blue waves, and enough hidden coves to make any smuggler jealous.",
    "Can I own land here?",
    "Not unless you marry a local or get creative with loopholes. But hey, colonialists never asked for permission either.",
    "Why is Sri Lanka great for tourism?",
    "Because even after centuries of invasions, tsunamis, and politicians, we still know how to throw a damn good party.",
    "Best Sri Lankan drink?",
    "Arrack. It’s what sailors drank when rum ran out, and it still knocks you flat the same way.",
    "Any cultural rules to follow?",
    "Don’t touch monks, don’t insult the Buddha, and don’t challenge grandmas at bargaining—because you will lose.",
    "Best souvenir to take home?",
    "A handcrafted mask, a bag of Ceylon tea, and if you’re feeling brave, a bottle of homemade coconut moonshine.",
    "Why is Sri Lankan food so spicy?",
    "Because life is suffering, and we like our food to remind us of that.",
    "What’s the transport situation?",
    "Trains are scenic, tuk-tuks are reckless, and buses are just fast-moving existential crises.",
    "Why are Sri Lankans so friendly?",
    "Because we’ve survived colonizers, wars, and inflation. We laugh in the face of chaos—so what’s a little hospitality?",
    "Why visit Sri Lanka?",
    "Because paradise isn’t paradise without a little danger.",
    "What’s the nightlife like?",
    "The drinks are cheap, the music is loud, and if you’re not careful, you’ll wake up missing a wallet and gaining a wild story.",
    "Is Sri Lanka expensive?",
    "Only if you don’t know how to haggle. Otherwise, you can live like a king on a peasant’s budget—just like the colonizers did.",
    "Best way to experience Sri Lanka?",
    "Get lost. No, seriously. The best adventures happen when Google Maps gives up on you.",
    "How’s the tea?",
    "Smooth, strong, and historically stolen. But at least now you can drink it guilt-free.",
    "Any local superstitions?",
    "Plenty. Step on a Buddhist temple’s threshold, and you’ll get cursed. Disrespect a cobra, and you’ll meet its cousin in your dreams.",
    "Why is Sri Lankan history so intense?",
    "Because every empire that came here wanted a piece, and we sent them back with a few missing teeth.",
    "Is corruption bad here?",
    "Let’s just say the real tourist attraction isn’t the beaches, it’s the politicians juggling their offshore accounts.",
    "Why invest here?",
    "Because in a land where rulers change like monsoon winds, the smart man builds his fortune in the shadows.",
    "What’s the dark side of Sri Lankan tourism?",
    "You’ll fall in love with this place… and realize too late that leaving is harder than you thought.",
    "Sigiriya",
    "A king built a fortress on a giant rock to escape his enemies. Spoiler: It didn’t work. But now you can climb it for the best view in Sri Lanka.",
    "Anuradhapura",
    "An ancient kingdom with temples older than most countries. Think of it as Sri Lanka’s version of Rome—if Rome had monks and fewer invasions.",
    "Polonnaruwa",
    "Ruins of a once-great city. Now it's full of monkeys and broken statues—just like politics, but with better architecture.",
    "Dambulla",
    "A temple inside a cave with 150+ Buddha statues. The message? Even monks knew real estate was expensive.",
    "Galle Fort",
    "Built by the Portuguese, fortified by the Dutch, and now owned by overpriced cafes and tourists. Colonialism never really left.",
    "Temple of the Tooth (Kandy)",
    "They say Buddha’s tooth is in there. Whether you believe it or not, the security is tighter than a pirate’s treasure chest.",
    "Jaffna Fort",
    "A fortress that changed hands between the Portuguese, Dutch, British, and eventually, Sri Lankans. Basically, history’s version of a tug-of-war.",
    "Ruwanwelisaya",
    "It’s massive, white, and full of ancient relics. Built by a king who knew the secret to immortality—leave behind a monument too big to ignore.",
    "Yapahuwa",
    "A forgotten rock fortress where kings once played hide-and-seek with invaders. Now, it’s just you and the ghosts of bad military decisions.",
    "Kataragama",
    "A holy city where gods, spirits, and desperate exam takers all come to make deals. Light a lamp, say a prayer, and hope the divine customer service is still active."
